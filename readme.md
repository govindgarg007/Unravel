**Unravel Backend Challenge**

This project is not a Spring Boot application,but we can use this classes in spring boot application as well to deal with numerous backend issues such as memory management, database connection pooling, concurrency, and session management. Advanced Java technologies like producer-consumer design, avoiding deadlocks, and multithreading are used in this project.

**Features**

1) Session Management: ConcurrentHashMap and ReentrantLock are used in this thread-safe session management system.
2) Memory Management: To stop memory leaks, WeakHashMap and caching are used.
3) Concurrency Handling: PriorityBlockingQueue is used to implement a producer-consumer model-based priority-based task management system.
4) Deadlock Prevention: ReentrantLock using tryLock() is used to regulate thread locking, hence preventing deadlocks.
5) HikariCP : HikariCP is used to configure database connection pooling, which allows for effective management of database connections.
6) REST APIs : RESTful endpoints for user session management (login, logout, and session information) are known as REST APIs.

When combined, these characteristics provide a highly efficient backend solution that offers improved scalability, dependability, and performance under concurrent user loads.

**Required Dependencies**

This project requires several dependencies, including:

1) Spring Boot Starter Web: For creating REST APIs and running the Spring Boot application.
2) Spring Boot Starter Data JPA: For database interaction with JPA.
3) HikariCP: For database connection pooling.
4) Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code.
5) MySQL Connector: To connect to a MySQL database.



 
**IDE**
IntelliJ : The IntelliJ IDE may be utilized to install all necessary dependencies automatically.

**Note:**

I have provided an optimal solution by implementing the code in separate classes. This approach ensures that the code can be utilized in various environments, including J2EE, Spring, and Spring Boot frameworks.
Each class is organized within its respective directory for better structure and reusability.
